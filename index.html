    <h1 class="headerA">Andrew Swallie's Web Development Porfolio</h1>
    <p class="paragraph"> Hello! My name is Andrew Swallie, a student of Computer Science at Weber State University (WSU). 
        I was born in Chicago, IL, before moving to Arizona in the early 2010s when I was 12. 
        I have been living in Utah for almost 6 years now, during which time I have been working to pay for school and taking as many classes as I can. 
        I started taking full semesters agian a few years ago, finishing as many courses at Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) as I could before coming here to 
        Ogden. I have been invested in computers for my entire life, primarily in the form of games. I played my first game, World of Warcraft, when I was only 4 or 5
        years old, and have maintained an active subscription for the majority of the two decades since. I mention this investment into gaming because,
        starting around 2023, I joined the SLCC esports team, becoming their first national champion in the game of Hearthstone. I continued playing for both
        the Hearthstone and League of Legends teams at SLCC before coming to WSU. League of Legends is a major reason I came to WSU, because our team for this 
        game is exceptionally talented, and in order to hone my own skills and develop into future potential career paths, I can find no better school or resrouce
        than the team at WSU. 
    </p>
    <p class="pargraph"> This is a portfolio website I am using to hone my Web Development skills in pursuit of my major. I will be posting projects and their progress here over the 
        next semester. I am excited to have the opportunity to learn and develop these skills this semester, just as much as any other skills WSU can, and will, teach me.
    </p>
